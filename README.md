localsearch
===========

Local search algorithms for optimization problems:

- Tabu search
- RNA search

This library is being developed as part of a larger timetabling/scheduling project called Skolaris and is not directly usable as a whole.
However the generic implementation of notorious algorithms might be interesting and of use.
There's currently no standalone documentation available. Browse the source files for that.
